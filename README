I practiced Conway's Game of Life during Obtiva's Code Retreat. It's a great
exercise to throw away your code. But tonight I couldn't sleep until I felt a
solution leave my head and hands.

This should produce a nice "glider" in your console...

ruby renderer.rb

If you look at the source and the history, you'll notice I used just a couple
high level tests for sanity checks. The rest I did from the repetitive practice
that etched some of these structures into my head. It would be fun to fork
this and refactor it in lots of better ways.

Enjoy!
